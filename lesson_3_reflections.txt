When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when i have to work on the repository from the multiple computers, not using only one local machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If I am working on a new feature, i need to work on long days and make lots of codes, but it is still logically functioning as a feature, so i want to commit it once. If the git automatically stay up-to-date to my remote repository then it would make a lot more commits than i want.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks: when i clone from the repository on github to the server on github which i can access.

	clone: when i make a local repository from a repository on github or on local.

	branch: when i make a another branch on local from a repository on local

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	making it easy to sync with the local branch?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	?
