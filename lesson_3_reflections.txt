When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when i have to work on the repository from the multiple computers, not using only one local machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If I am working on a new feature, i need to work on long days and make lots of codes, but it is still logically functioning as a feature, so i want to commit it once. If the git automatically stay up-to-date to my remote repository then it would make a lot more commits than i want.
